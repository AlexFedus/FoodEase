# FoodEase

This project is a restaurant automation system.

Introduction
============

This project was created as a software engineering class group project by four students.
The development of this project was done while learning about different project managment techniques
including Agile, Waterfall, Scrum, and Kanban. 

In this project, we followed the Scrum method and I served as the Scrum Master.

Note
====

Becuase of the style this class followed, this project was developed
in a very short period of time. Therefore, this is not a completely 
developed project. The goal of this project was to utilize the Scrum method
and showcase our ability to use it.

When ran, this program shows a homepage where users can choose from a variety of options.
A user can view tables in a restaurant and change their availability, add and delete
employees from the system, clock in and clock out, view current orders, and show which
orders are completed by the kitchen. A user can also view a menu where are items
are shown. 

Tools Used
==========

To develop this project, we strictly used Java and utilized the Swing framework
to create the gui.
